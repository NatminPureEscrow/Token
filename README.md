# The Natmin Token
The Natmin Token (NAT) is a digital token that powers the Escrow platform. It will be used to fund transactions between buyers and sellers. It also ensures utmost security and peace of mind between the buyer and seller.

NAT is an unmineable token built on the ERC20 / ERC223 standard using the Ethereum Blockchain, which makes it a widely used and an accepted standard. The upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) will be the only time Natmin Tokens will be created.
